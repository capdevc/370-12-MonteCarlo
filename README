"clean" script will remove all the images, movie and data for a new run.

In the animation, black squares are empty, grey squares are susceptible

patients start red, and then progress through yellow to green 

output files:

mcarlo.avi 	- movie showing the infection progress in one run
mcarlo???.png 	- images showing daily status in that same run
mcarlo.txt	- optional raw dump of each run's data
